## Introduction
Bandit is an introductory wargame focused on **Linux fundamentals**, **command-line fluency**, and the kind of system-level thinking that security work builds on.

My goal is not to “show solutions,” but to document a **consistent process**: how I read the task, what I try first, what fails, what I learn, and how I validate results.

## What this series is
**This series is:**
- Short, practical notes on my learning process
- Emphasis on **Linux concepts** and security-oriented thinking
- Clean structure so I can revisit later




## Levels
I will add level posts progressively as I complete them:

- Bandit: Level 0 → 1 *(coming soon)*
- Bandit: Level 1 → 2 *(coming soon)*
- Bandit: Level 2 → 3 *(coming soon)*
- ...

> Note: I will keep the posts concise and focus on the underlying concept rather than dumping commands.
